# Overview
User Story:

The user is a local organizer for the social dance community who collects information from many venues and for many categories in order to accommodate the social dance community for monthly availabilities to socialize in a like minded group.   In order   to do this the organizer (Ralph) must visit every website on his list and or call the venue to acquire dj   and band information.   He then produces several pdfâ€™s  with the gathered information and sends them out via his collected email list. Over 1000.


Scope:

Build an app that has the ability to accept simplified data for venues and their entertainment schedule and then produce a document or webpage that produces the results from a webcrawl/search mechanism in real-time.
